# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday - September 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started this challenge! Figured out how to preview markdown in vscode (`Shift+âŒ˜+V`)

**Thoughts**: Did some preliminary research on business ideas today, specifically a tool for animating on top of video, and a tool for automating lip sync animations. Also got a book to read for market research (Deploy Empathy). TBH, spending time on business stuff, like market research and books and long term goals is harder for me than programming. I could just jump off the cliff of building a product now, but I haven't validated anything. Talking to people and figuring out what they're struggling with is the real hard thing. Of course building software is hard, but I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of hard. It's the people... geez they're terrifying.

### Day 2: Tuesday - September 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Webflow website. I can't believe I haven't used it till now. It's wonderful. Made a masonry grid using [this](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Masonry-Grid). Read up and tried image SEO optimization using Photoshop for compression and Adobe Bridge for renaming and applying metadata (some resources I used [here](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/image-resolution), [here](https://flothemes.com/everything-photographer-seo/), and [here](https://www.foregroundweb.com/image-size/))

**Thoughts**: Read more of Deploy Empathy. I'm not as confident in the idea I investigated yesterday, and I'm wondering now where I should even start looking for opportunities. I made myself a goal though, to interview one person that isn't family or close friends. I'm hoping that by starting small maybe it'll kick off a chain reaction. I broadened my criteria for finding a business idea, to picking several areas I want to investigate.

The expectation to code every day is good for me. Otherwise, I think I would just hyperfocus on the whole market research thing, and because market research is new and hard, I'd exhaust myself really fast. Making progress in other things that are tangible (or as tangible as code is), seems to help keep me grounded.

### Day 3: Wednesday - September 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Webflow site more. I really wanted to hook it up to a custom domain, but ran into the Pay Wall. I ended up just redirecting the custom domain to the webflow subdomain, because the site is just that much better. It'll hurt SEO, but whatever. Also spent a lot of time adding alt tags to photos. Created a form and a fun custom animation for the link based on a tutorial I stumbled into.

**Thoughts**: Being on Twitter is kind of scary. A Godot developer (like he contributes to the Godot codebase) promoted my World Wrap tutorial on his Twitter just out of the kindness of his heart, and I got like 500 views on the video and over 100 new subscribers on my Youtube channel. Which is still small potatoes, but is also tons more than I've ever had. And it is very scary. One of the Twitter guys who saw that tweet found me on Twitter, which is absurd. I have no idea how he did that.

I'm learning that I am extremely sensitive to people watching me. I knew this before, but it just cuts really deep right now. I want to go hide. I don't think I will though. I feel scared, but I also feel strong enough to face it right now. Weird. I have never felt that before.

### Day 4: Thursday - September 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up Webflow site experiment by updating favicon and webclip logos, and trying to update site metadata and logos on the Wordpress site just for how search engine results look. Not sure if it was successful, but it's time for me to move on.

Read Godot article on their version 4 beta release. Started a new project plan to complete a game for Halloween by October 24. I decided to try and be smart about tackling that goal and looked up strategies to manage game projects, and found a video on [HeartBeast's Production Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMHicoZTzQ) management paradigm, and I've decided to use it for this little project.

### Day 5: Friday - September 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of research on game mechanics and other games to draw inspiration from. Set up a basic Godot 4.0 project with 2.5D look. I'm thinking of going the Don't Starve route with the game right now.

**Thoughts**: Developing good game mechanics is hard. That's kind of obvious, but I'm feeling it a lot right now. I am very worried about over-scoping this game, and of not making an interesting game mechanic the center of the game. I think maybe I'm getting too ambitious with the story maybe, and leaning on it too much to carry the game. That's why I'm gonna just start building, and see what happens. I'm going to try to have people play test it as much as possible.

### Day 6: Saturday - September 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got Godot's 4.0 language server working with VS Code again (changed port to 6005 according to [this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin/issues/244)). Got basic inventory system set up and experimented with varying player movement speed based on "health".

**Thoughts**: I don't think that mechanic is very fun. It might work better if it makes the player spaz around a little. I'll try that tomorrow. I also need to nail down the driving emotions of the game, because I think that'll help steer the types of mechanics that I create.

### Day 7: Sunday - September 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Impelemented a mechanic where once player health drops below 50, a random direction is added/subtracted in the x and y/z directions. This makes the movement unpredictable and jittery. It's not very fun to move around with. It feels mostly just like a bug. Also brainstormed the emotions of Halloween so that I can try to use those as inspiration for game mechanics.

**Thoughts**: Creating game mechanics is hard, and I feel myself slowing down and getting stuck. Tomorrow I'll need to do some research on cool game mechanics, and then brainstorm a bunch and make a little list of ones to test out.

Feeling a little discouraged about the task of figuring out a game mechanic that is solid. I'm worried I don't have it in my to figure out.
