# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday - September 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started this challenge! Figured out how to preview markdown in vscode (`Shift+âŒ˜+V`)

**Thoughts**: Did some preliminary research on business ideas today, specifically a tool for animating on top of video, and a tool for automating lip sync animations. Also got a book to read for market research (Deploy Empathy). TBH, spending time on business stuff, like market research and books and long term goals is harder for me than programming. I could just jump off the cliff of building a product now, but I haven't validated anything. Talking to people and figuring out what they're struggling with is the real hard thing. Of course building software is hard, but I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of hard. It's the people... geez they're terrifying.

### Day 2: Tuesday - September 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Webflow website. I can't believe I haven't used it till now. It's wonderful. Made a masonry grid using [this](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Masonry-Grid). Read up and tried image SEO optimization using Photoshop for compression and Adobe Bridge for renaming and applying metadata (some resources I used [here](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/image-resolution), [here](https://flothemes.com/everything-photographer-seo/), and [here](https://www.foregroundweb.com/image-size/))

**Thoughts**: Read more of Deploy Empathy. I'm not as confident in the idea I investigated yesterday, and I'm wondering now where I should even start looking for opportunities. I made myself a goal though, to interview one person that isn't family or close friends. I'm hoping that by starting small maybe it'll kick off a chain reaction. I broadened my criteria for finding a business idea, to picking several areas I want to investigate.

The expectation to code every day is good for me. Otherwise, I think I would just hyperfocus on the whole market research thing, and because market research is new and hard, I'd exhaust myself really fast. Making progress in other things that are tangible (or as tangible as code is), seems to help keep me grounded.
