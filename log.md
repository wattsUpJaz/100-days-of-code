# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday - September 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started this challenge! Figured out how to preview markdown in vscode (`Shift+âŒ˜+V`)

**Thoughts**: Did some preliminary research on business ideas today, specifically a tool for animating on top of video, and a tool for automating lip sync animations. Also got a book to read for market research (Deploy Empathy). TBH, spending time on business stuff, like market research and books and long term goals is harder for me than programming. I could just jump off the cliff of building a product now, but I haven't validated anything. Talking to people and figuring out what they're struggling with is the real hard thing. Of course building software is hard, but I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of hard. It's the people... geez they're terrifying.
