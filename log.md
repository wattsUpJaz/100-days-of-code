# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday - September 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started this challenge! Figured out how to preview markdown in vscode (`Shift+âŒ˜+V`)

**Thoughts**: Did some preliminary research on business ideas today, specifically a tool for animating on top of video, and a tool for automating lip sync animations. Also got a book to read for market research (Deploy Empathy). TBH, spending time on business stuff, like market research and books and long term goals is harder for me than programming. I could just jump off the cliff of building a product now, but I haven't validated anything. Talking to people and figuring out what they're struggling with is the real hard thing. Of course building software is hard, but I'm pretty comfortable with that kind of hard. It's the people... geez they're terrifying.

### Day 2: Tuesday - September 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Webflow website. I can't believe I haven't used it till now. It's wonderful. Made a masonry grid using [this](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Masonry-Grid). Read up and tried image SEO optimization using Photoshop for compression and Adobe Bridge for renaming and applying metadata (some resources I used [here](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/image-resolution), [here](https://flothemes.com/everything-photographer-seo/), and [here](https://www.foregroundweb.com/image-size/))

**Thoughts**: Read more of Deploy Empathy. I'm not as confident in the idea I investigated yesterday, and I'm wondering now where I should even start looking for opportunities. I made myself a goal though, to interview one person that isn't family or close friends. I'm hoping that by starting small maybe it'll kick off a chain reaction. I broadened my criteria for finding a business idea, to picking several areas I want to investigate.

The expectation to code every day is good for me. Otherwise, I think I would just hyperfocus on the whole market research thing, and because market research is new and hard, I'd exhaust myself really fast. Making progress in other things that are tangible (or as tangible as code is), seems to help keep me grounded.

### Day 3: Wednesday - September 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Webflow site more. I really wanted to hook it up to a custom domain, but ran into the Pay Wall. I ended up just redirecting the custom domain to the webflow subdomain, because the site is just that much better. It'll hurt SEO, but whatever. Also spent a lot of time adding alt tags to photos. Created a form and a fun custom animation for the link based on a tutorial I stumbled into.

**Thoughts**: Being on Twitter is kind of scary. A Godot developer (like he contributes to the Godot codebase) promoted my World Wrap tutorial on his Twitter just out of the kindness of his heart, and I got like 500 views on the video and over 100 new subscribers on my Youtube channel. Which is still small potatoes, but is also tons more than I've ever had. And it is very scary. One of the Twitter guys who saw that tweet found me on Twitter, which is absurd. I have no idea how he did that.

I'm learning that I am extremely sensitive to people watching me. I knew this before, but it just cuts really deep right now. I want to go hide. I don't think I will though. I feel scared, but I also feel strong enough to face it right now. Weird. I have never felt that before.

### Day 4: Thursday - September 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up Webflow site experiment by updating favicon and webclip logos, and trying to update site metadata and logos on the Wordpress site just for how search engine results look. Not sure if it was successful, but it's time for me to move on.

Read Godot article on their version 4 beta release. Started a new project plan to complete a game for Halloween by October 24. I decided to try and be smart about tackling that goal and looked up strategies to manage game projects, and found a video on [HeartBeast's Production Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMHicoZTzQ) management paradigm, and I've decided to use it for this little project.

### Day 5: Friday - September 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of research on game mechanics and other games to draw inspiration from. Set up a basic Godot 4.0 project with 2.5D look. I'm thinking of going the Don't Starve route with the game right now.

**Thoughts**: Developing good game mechanics is hard. That's kind of obvious, but I'm feeling it a lot right now. I am very worried about over-scoping this game, and of not making an interesting game mechanic the center of the game. I think maybe I'm getting too ambitious with the story maybe, and leaning on it too much to carry the game. That's why I'm gonna just start building, and see what happens. I'm going to try to have people play test it as much as possible.

### Day 6: Saturday - September 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got Godot's 4.0 language server working with VS Code again (changed port to 6005 according to [this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin/issues/244)). Got basic inventory system set up and experimented with varying player movement speed based on "health".

**Thoughts**: I don't think that mechanic is very fun. It might work better if it makes the player spaz around a little. I'll try that tomorrow. I also need to nail down the driving emotions of the game, because I think that'll help steer the types of mechanics that I create.

- [Godot Project Repo](https://github.com/wattsUpJaz/Halloween2022)

### Day 7: Sunday - September 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Impelemented a mechanic where once player health drops below 50, a random direction is added/subtracted in the x and y/z directions. This makes the movement unpredictable and jittery. It's not very fun to move around with. It feels mostly just like a bug. Also brainstormed the emotions of Halloween so that I can try to use those as inspiration for game mechanics.

**Thoughts**: Creating game mechanics is hard, and I feel myself slowing down and getting stuck. Tomorrow I'll need to do some research on cool game mechanics, and then brainstorm a bunch and make a little list of ones to test out.

Feeling a little discouraged about the task of figuring out a game mechanic that is solid. I'm worried I don't have it in my to figure out.

### Day 8: Monday - September 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did a LOT of research into game mechanics and player stats and stuff. Hashed out some mechanics.

**Thoughts**: It felt like a step back taking time to figure out mechanics, but it's important I think, and I think it's helping me move forward.

### Day 9: Tuesday - September 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finally have a plan. Wittled the plan down to an MVP. Implemented basic player stats (health, food, stamina, and courage) and created items (pumpkin, acorn, dandelion, taffy). Switched Sprite3Ds to be in Billboard mode instead of manually setting their rotation.

**Thoughts**: I definitely went psycho on the scope of this. Luckily I realized it and scoped it way down to an MVP. I got a lot done today. Having a clear plan really really helped the programming for me. I'm still not sure how fun it will all turn out though. We will see.

### Day 10: Wednesday - September 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned a lot about random number generation and noise. [This article](https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/noise/introduction.html) was super helpful in understanding the differences between the colors of noise. Studied [GDQuest's procedural generation repo](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-procedural-generation) A LOT. Learned that calculating distances using squared values is better (to avoid the square root computation, so it's much faster). Started to learn abour viewports, but didn't figure it out.

**Thoughts**: Starting to get overwhelmed again. I think I overscoped on this procedural generation thing. I think I gotta take a step back maybe.

### Day 11: Thursday - September 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Struggled to get the SubViewport to work in Godot 4.0 with the Viewport Texture. It would show up in the editor, but on build it would just look like a solid color. It worked for a second, but then broke again, so I have a feeling it's because I'm using the beta 4.0 version.

**Thoughts**: Might switch back to the stable version of Godot for this project. I'm running into a lot of obstacles, and I just want to make something fast. Jared said some stuff about maybe me holding myself back by not working with people right now. It hurt to hear, but I think he's right to a degree. It hurts because I've been trying so hard lately, and I feel like I've figured some important stuff out. I feel like what he said means I may need to pivot again, and I'm so tired of pivoting into something new all the time and not finishing anything. Lots of not nice feelings today.

### Day 12: Friday - September 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Remade the project in 2D to avoid issues I was running into with 3D. Created basic enemy AI and HUD and player.

**Thoughts**: Today was hard. Did something though. Really reconsidering if I'm on the right track or not with this game dev thing. I try so hard, but in the end it doesn't really matter (hahaaa I'm crying).

### Day 13: Saturday - September 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed enemy script to be much more understandable. It resembles a quick and dirty state machine. I need to do it for the player. Player stun mechanic is broken, and the code is so bad I can't figure out where to add anything. Made art for player and enemy also.

**Thoughts**: Art is good for the soul. Things are still hard, but doing a little bit of art gave me some hope.

### Day 14: Sunday - September 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the player script and the capture mechanic for the enemy. Added stun and waking mechanic for player. This quick n' dirty state machine pattern is working well for me so far. Made a stun/fainting animation for the player.

Forgot to mention I learned about BOIDs the other day. I want to make some for my game. They're so fun looking.

**Thoughts**: Made it to 2 weeks! The player and enemy interaction is feeling a lot more fun. The capture mechanic is kinna cool. I'm hoping that with all the art it might actually resemble a decently fun game to play. I still feel like an imposter, but I've resolved that there is no immediate action for me to take on it right now, so I'm just gonna keep going. I feel proud that I've made it 2 weeks having worked on code every day. This log thing is really helping me stay focussed.

### Day 15: Monday - September 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Hooked up the animations for the enemy and player, and created the witch's house with basic mechanics and art. Tweaked the enemy mechanics / hit areas to work with the sprite (instead of the polygon2D) and added Y-Sort (this was way easier than I was expecting. Did a little bit of planning for the future.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I put a lot of hard work in today, but I don't feel super satisfied. Adding the art makes the game feel much more real, but I'm very nervous about the overall feel. Tt's still feeling pretty amateur-ish to me I think. Ugh. Small wins I guess.

I need to figure out the Navigation server at some point so the enemy navigates around obstacles. That's going to be a beast.

### Day 16: Tuesday - September 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed enemy + player + witch house interactions so that they're cleaner and enemies can interact with each other without breaking everything. Created a prototype of the spell casting mini game. Learned how to use [Line2D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyDm0MmGqg)

**Thoughts**: The mini game is kind of cool, but it feels just a little to hard to grasp right now. Maybe I'll simplify it down in the beginning. Writing down a list of things to do yesterday really helped me tackle the harder problems today. I was really dreading figuring out that mini game, but I made a lot of progress on it today, even though it still feels funky. I think I do the very detailed work and the very high level work descently. It's this middle ground where the prototypes need to make the jump into finished product that's killing me. I'm very nervous that my work will only ever feel amateur-ish. Hey, I'm still here trying though. Trying as hard as I can.

### Day 17: Wednesday - September 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the spell casting movement logic so that it feels much more intuitive. Started experimenting with ways to integrate it into the main scene, but didn't get very far. Accidentally ran `git reset --hard` on my branch before adding or commiting any of my changes. Luckily I had all the new spell casting stuff in a new folder that was untracked, so git didn't touch it. I'm such an idiot. Also, I hate not being able to use VS Code as my editor without Godot freaking out and crashing every five minutes.

**Thoughts**: I suck, but I'm not gonna settle for suck. Just gonna keep drilling at this thing until something breaks or I hit a diamond or something, I don't know this analogy is not good. I think I need to make a devlog about this game thing and maybe try to get it out by October 1, cuz Halloween month and whatnot. That's two days. Yeeeikes.

### Day 18: Thursday - September 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Connected the spell casting mini game and the main game. Haven't implemented the spell effects yet though. Made a tileset that's broken. Tried to add a shadow shader, but that didn't work either.

**Thoughts**: Game development is hard and dumb. Like shaders??? What the actual flamingo. Why am I doing this.

### Day 19: Friday - September 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added spell effect that damages enemies. Made the logic for hiding and showing the spell caster better (Player can't cast spells while stunned or waking). Player doesn't move when spell caster is open. Collider for witch house still broken.

**Thoughts**: Waking up early is nice. Game feels... too hard? Too easy? Too awkward? Yeah, too awkward. And unfortantely, I don't really know how to fix that right now.

### Day 20: Sat/Sun - October 1-2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Didn't work on stuff a ton during the weekend, but tweaked player-enemy-spell interactions a tiny bit. Filmed a devlog and got through the rough edit.

**Thoughts**: Personal life needed some TLC this weekend, so it wasn't super productive in the game department. It was very productive in the rest and recovery department though, so that's a win. Tomorrow's goals are to finish the devlog, release it, and get back at programming.

### Day 21: Monday - October 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the devlog today. Learned some new git commands while poking around my repo history. `git checkout [commit hash]` checks you out at a certain commit. `git checkout *` discards any changes you have.

**Thoughts**: Making videos takes so long it's almost painful. But, I think I get a lot of satisfaction from it. I'm too tired right now to know for sure though.

### Day 22: Tuesday - October 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked up the courage to try and tackle lighting. It didn't go super great.

**Thoughts**: Progress was slow today, but I'm still trying. Lighting and a day-night cycle now, then shaders for when the player is behind stuff, then spawning enemies in shadows. So much more to do, holy moly.

### Day 23: Wednesday - October 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Turns out the problem I was running into yesterday is actually a [recorded bug](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/64939), which unfortunately means what I'm trying to do is impossible right now. BUT, I found a workaround pretty soon after, because I have a problem with proving people wrong when they say something is impossible.

**Thoughts**: Slow progress, but when there's a will there's a way. Also, people are so nice on Youtube. At least, the one's that I've interacted with so far are. I'm not feeling confident in my ability to turn this into a real game still though. And also second guessing how unique the game mechanic actually is. Maybe it isn't at all.

### Day 24: Thursday - October 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tackled the navigation server and made the enemies move around the house and into it when they capture the player. This [video by bitbrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MTJ9Qz0gJk) was awesome. Fixed bug with spell casting (spell caster would stay open when the player was stunned). Figured out something that will work for lighting, and created a scene for the day-night cycle. Updated to-do list to stay focused.

**Thoughts**: Progress was better today. I really avoid the things that are most important to do, usually because they are the most intimidating too. Writing them down really helped me jump into figuring them out. Found some good inspiration in Cult of the Lamb for art style (cute and creepy), and [Arx Fatalis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Valmsq_Ku90) for spell casting.

### Day 25: Friday - October 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed player light occluder to change when the player is stunned. Implemented day counter. Learned that the Godot editor highlights type-safe lines in green (I have a lot of not type safe lines). Researched shaders but didn't do anything with what I learned. Started implementing death state for enemies (need to finish tomorrow). Tried to add a tilemap layer for grasses that were y sorted. It didn't work.

**Thoughts**: Started a lot of random stuff today, but didn't really complete much. I get distracted sooo easily. I really need to focus if I'm going to get this game looking decent in two weeks.

### Day 26: Saturday - October 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fought with tilemap y-sorting grass blades. May have discovered a bug in Godot 4 where y-sorted objects interact in a weird way when their parent and them indiviually have y-sort enabled. Sprites would appear on top when they should be underneath, and then update to be correct when they overlapped enough. More investigation needed. Worked on spell casting art a little.

**Thoughts**: Decided to give up on making grass blades for the environment because of the way y-sort was acting. I was able to get it working, but at the expense of the other scene sprites interacting very oddly with each other. Maybe I'll try re-ordering the scene tree later to see if that helps anything.

### Day 26: Sun/Mon - October 9-10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: The turn-off filtering on import equivalent is now in Project Settings > Default Texture Filter, and setting it to Nearest. Tilesets still flicker once in awhile though. I think [this github issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/55006) is the one I'm running into. Recreated the tileset and started working on updating the character. Added spell assets.

**Thoughts**: Art made me mad today. It's so difficult making art that lives up to the standard you have in your head. I fell waaaayyy short today. Oh well.

### Day 27: Tuesday - October 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fought with art again. Fixed the above github issue by making the tiles 1 pixel smaller than they are on the atlas so that there's a 1 px margin around. From the issue it seemed like the flicker was being caused by the engine needing to sample from outside the tile area. Giving the tile a buffer seemed to fix it.

Recreated the main character and witch house. Fought with y sort and the tilemap. I can not figure out how to make them work together without adding the player as a child of the tilemap. I ended up following [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/vg5xfn/how_does_ysort_work_in_godot_4/).

Added mouth to house. Added trees.

**Thoughts**: Figuring out how to make a world look full is really hard. So far I feel like I'm failing pretty thoroughly at it. I'm starting to get really worried that I'm not going to be able to make this game fun in the amount of time I have. I'm worried that for it to be fun will require lots of content, and I just don't have time to make a bunch of content. I think I need to really plan out my next steps a lot tomorrow.

### Day 28: Wednesday - October 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got a plan together (it's way too big). Pretty sure I found a bug with Godot crashing when you try to use a Tilemap navigation layer and a NavigationRegion2D node together. But, maybe you're not suppose to do that anyway. Made a million tiny changes to tilesets to try and get it looking good. Unfortunately, so far nothing's done the trick.

**Thoughts**: I really should have listened when I was told to leave the art alone for the time being. But I just keep feeling like I'm so close to getting it right. I want to watch this [video by AdamCYounis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCG4fCmeHk&t=125s) tomorrow for help on desiging top-down art. Also ask some advice from people. So much to do, so much to do. But I usually get most everything done in the last couple days of game jams, so maybe that'll happen with this too.

### Day 29: Thursday - October 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on art all today again. Mia is a life saver. Removed sun scene with shadows and used simple lamp + canvas modulate with no shadows. Updated art assets by adding drop shadows to everything, adding shadows on the objects, creating trees, tweaking the modulate on the tilemap layers, fixing the collision shapes, recreating the leaves tileset, and updating the player's outfit.

Note: I need to go back and delete all the .import files that were created from all the different versions of assets I tried.

**Thoughts:** Watching top-down tilemap tutorial videos helped a lot, but I was still hitting dead-ends. Mia really helped identify why it was looking so funky, and helping tweak the colors to compliment each other while still making the player stand out. She has incredible skill with color. I am so grateful for her help with figuring out how to make the scene work. I feel like I can finally move forward with assembling the rest of the game now. I'm relieved, and also freaked out at how much I'll need to tackle in the next week.

### Day 30: Friday - October 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got most of the intro scene figured out. Created a dialog system. Created sooo many area triggers. The frame rate drops sometimes and I'm not sure why. I'll need to investigate using the profiler at some point and look into optimization.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling overwhelmed and worried about burning out on this project. I think I bit off more than I can chew, but I feel that deep down I'm committed to trying to pull it off. That scares me a bit, because there is just so much. The art will probably be my downfall. I don't think I'll be able to get it done as fast as I'm hoping I will, but that's my brain talking. My heart is idiotically optimistic about how quickly I'll figure stuff out. I guess that's kind of a nice problem to have. I try a lot of things because of it, and go farther than I think I would otherwise. But, I do a lot of unnecessary suffering because of it too.

### Day 31: Saturday - October 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

- Fixed bug with the enemies. They all return the house when the player is captured now (I was conditionally setting the house location, and enemies that weren't attacking never got the house location set as their target).
- Turned off collect ability on player when they're stunned.
- Offset timing of enemy move animation so that they don't all sync together in game.
- Removed house camera and just made a trigger for it in the intro scene.
- Added deactivation of enemy when they enter the house so that other enemies can enter.
- Fixed y-sorting of player, house, and enemies so they work with the tileset. I have no idea when that got out of sync, because it was working earlier.

Will work on the witch house interior assets, but will be done with coding for today.

**Thoughts**: Getting out and hiking was so good for the soul today, in so many ways. I read an [article by stuffed wombat]("https://stuffedwomb.at/producering_10") on using pomodoro (or whatever) methods to help him(?) be super productive, so I tried that this evening. Suprisingly I think it helped a bit. I got all the coding above done in about an hour I think. I wasn't super good at keeping a detailed plan of what I was doing/going to do, and I didn't take any breaks, but I didn't go for very long also, so it worked for me. I want to experiment with it more over the next few days.

### Day 32: Sunday - October 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created base scene and tileset for witch house interior. Moved dialog controller to main world scene. Moved witch house assets to their own folder.

Tomorrow's tasks include:

- Set up spawn location for next scene so when you leave the house you spawn in front of it.
- Finish art for witch house interior
- Make maze mini game for leaving the house
- Art for witch lady
- Dialog sequence with witch
- Die sequence if you fail the mini game

**Thoughts**: One week left. Oh noooooo.

### Day 33: Monday - October 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created art for decorations inside the witch's house and figured out how to export them all as separate assets. Tried to place them using Tilemap, but I needed more freedom in where they're placed, so I'll place them as sprites. Didn't get to basically everything on the list above. I saw that coming though.

**Thoughts**: I'm entertaining the idea that I won't finish this more and more. And, maybe that's okay. I'm gonna make a good push for it, but there's just so much. Like soooo much.

### Day 34: Tuesday - October 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

- Pretty sure I found a legit bug. Godot crashes when you rename folders/files when scenes that use those paths/files are open.
- Used noise for the first time to make light flicker. Followed [this article](https://www.phonoforest.com/2020/05/7-second-tutorial-smooth-flickering.html) by Phono Forest.
- Finished designing the scene for inside the witch's house with props and lighting and an actualy witch.
- Actually created a mini game for escaping the witch's house (I really didn't think that one was going to happen). It's not hooked up yet though.

**Thoughts**: My wrist hurts from using my mouse. And my brain feels extremely fuzzy. But I got a lot done today, and I ate delicious curry. I'm trying to keep the panic from wrecking havoc on everything, but I feel there, waiting, building. Horrible.

### Day 35: Wednesday - October 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

- Used the new `super()` method to call parent methods. This isn't a new idea, but it use to be different in Godot 3
- Hooked up mini game to scene
- Created dialog for Witch
- Used a legit shader for the first time. Just copied [this one](https://godotshaders.com/shader/ripple-shader/) by Nevoski
- Added game state for difficulty and spawn locations
- Need to create lose state for mini game

### Day 36: Thursday - October 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

- Added basic lose state for mini game. This is the lose state for the whole game.
- Make variable that turns the witch house door on an off.

**Thoughts**: Today was a chill day, and was really nice. I'm watching a K-Drama rn, so my thoughts aren't super extensive...

### Day 37: Friday - October 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

- Updated spell casting design
- Created spell book
- Created wand collectable
- Created main loop scene
- Added active variable to spells
- Differentiated light and damage spells
- Update witch house can_enter to use setter
- Make witch house enterable in main loop scene

Things to fix:

- Weird pulsing of dizzy filter when entering witch house
- Exiting witch house doesn't go to the right place
- Could cast light spell early
- Maybe light follows you for a little bit? Maybe it paints light down for a little bit. Either way, need to solve the problem of the light spell being too slow and needing to cast it too often.
- Spell for damage is awkward with needing to press down twice.

**Thoughts**: Pieces are coming together! I think that I'm realizing that the infrastructure I've created is helpful in making new mechanics and scenes. Things aren't taking nearly as long as they were a few days ago. That being said, I still don't think I'll be able to finish everything I wanted to. I'm realizing that I should've focussed waaayyy more on making the game loop fun before fitting in the narrative part. I was just so excited about the story telling (cry).

I think my time would've been better spent adding content to the game loop (which is basically a survival zombie-type game-play) by creating different forms of enemies, more spells, and testing it a bunch to balance everything. Maybe there's still time for a little bit of that. I also still need to create the menu, UI, and sounds fx though. Ugh, this is gnarly. Fun, but wow so gnarly.

### Day 38: Saturday - October 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

- Fix weird pulsing dizzy shader
- Make learning spells part of game state
- Remove wands from main loop if you get it in intro scene
- Remove dir for spell effects (too specific to have in interface)
- Make light follow your direction for a little bit
- Spell caster wand will automatically move to next point if key is held down
- Tweak light spell so that it lasts longer and is brighter and fixed the y-sorting
- Make spell effects wrap when player wraps
- Add main loop for the witch house's interior.
- Add basic dark forest scene

Next:

- Finish designing dark forest
- Add finding damage spell
- Fix damage spell look
- Add enemies (make sure they can die)
- Enemies far from house drag you and slowly fade your vision
- Add small enemy?

**Thoughts**: It felt good to get through those bugs today. Having my family playtest it as I go is really helpful, and I think it's helping me get better at recieving feedback in an objective way. As much as I want to be super objective about the work I do and how to make it better, in reality I'm pretty sensitive. I guess it's good I recognize that at least. Also, this environment is really good for practicing being more resilient and using the criticism as a way to improve. Everyone is super nice in the way they offer feedback and criticism.

### Day 38: Sun/Mon - October 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Pivoted away from the dark forest idea, because it was delaying the fighting part (which I think people want to do asap). Added more loopies to main map.

- Updated spells so that they're more different and light one is easier
- Give enemy death and stun states
- Spawn in enemies at edge of player vision
- Enemy / Player / Spell interaction bug fixes
- Day Night and day counter
- Add slow-down to world when spell casting
- make stun time gradually get longer

**Thoughts**: Had some big realizations today. First, I went about this whole game thing wrong. I should've focussed way more on refining the core game loop. Instead I got wrapped up in the storytelling and the art and the vibe. I love all that stuff, and in a different medium they'd be very important, but when it comes to games I think I'm just fully grasping that the balance of the different mechanics is paramount. I've known this in theory, but practicing it feels completely different.

Second, receiving feedback is both awesome and difficult. I love it and dread it. It's so good for course correction, but course correcting kinna hurts, especially when I've sunk so much time into the current course.

Third, I am now firmly rooted in the reality that I know absolutely nothing and I'm just here to learn stuff and share it along the way I guess.
